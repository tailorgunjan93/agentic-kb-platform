# ðŸ“¦ Semantic Agent-Based Knowledge Platform â€“ Database Layer

This PostgreSQL schema powers a modular agentic knowledge base system with support for file ingestion, semantic search, multi-agent workflows, and curated global knowledge. It uses `pgvector` for embeddings and `pgcrypto` for UUID generation.
